#README#

This repository hosts some of the very basic programs in the C-Programming Language, and the implementations of a number of Data Structures in C. The purpose of this repo is *strictly* academic, that is, they are homework-style problems designed for the perusal of students who study C and Data Structures. 

However, students are **discouraged** to use these programs *as-is* in their homework problems. (As a matter of fact, they are not allowed to do so either. See the [license](https://github.com/rajatarora/BasicCAndDS/blob/master/LICENSE) file for more details.)

Just look at these programs, and try to implement them on their own. They are sufficiently documented with comments that will help you get started. 

Should you find any mistake in the code, or find a better way to do something and wish to tell me, or want any further explanations of the code, feel free to contact me at [rajat@rajatarora.info](mailto:rajat@rajatarora.info).

Happy Coding!
